# Components Directory Structure

This directory contains all React components used throughout the application.

## Directory Organization

- `/common` - Reusable UI components used across multiple features (buttons, inputs, cards, etc.)
- `/layout` - Components related to the application layout (header, footer, navigation, etc.)
- `/features` - Feature-specific components organized by domain/feature
- `/hooks` - Custom React hooks used across components
- `/providers` - Context providers and other wrapper components

## Best Practices

1. Keep components small and focused
2. Use TypeScript for type safety
3. Implement proper prop validation
4. Write unit tests for components
5. Document component usage with comments/JSDoc
